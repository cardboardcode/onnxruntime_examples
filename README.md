## What Is This?
A repository contains a bunch of examples of getting onnxruntime up and running in C++ and Python.

There is a `README.md` under each example. So read that to get started on that example you want.

## Getting Started with [**onnxruntime**]
You can't run any of the C++ examples here if you don't build the library first.

Follow the commands below to build it. Don't worry. Here's a **bash script** to make it smoother.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cardboardcode/onnxruntime_examples.git
cd onnxruntme_examples
sudo chmod u+x install_onnx_runtime_cpu.sh
./install_onnx_runtime_cpu.sh
```

## Acknowledgement
1. The installation script, `install_onnx_runtime_cpu.sh`, was written by **[xmba15](https://github.com/xmba15/onnx_runtime_cpp)** here. Check his/her repository out. Beware the lack of documentation though.
